# High Order Attention Model Visual Question Answering in Tensorflow
# By : Mihir Phatak & Vrunal Mhatre

Our initial effort has been to get started with paper's implementation.
We used palmetto clusters with Anaconda to setup environment for packages and modules required.
Since, our implementation has been in tensorflow, instead of torch and lua. We had to make use of the 
models and optimizers in tensorflow library for our project. LSTM and Adam optimizer to name a few.

We also took reference of the standard data preprocessing tools provided by http://www.visualqa.org/.

Package Requirements:
Python2.6
Tensorflow
numpy
h5py
nltk
Scipy
cuDnnv8.051
cuda-toolkit

Data:
Use the vqa_preprocessing.py file after downloading the data set from http://cocodataset.org/#download.

We have implemented the techniques discussed in our first report using tensorflow library.The data embedding layer with tf.graph to store features within images 
extracted through VGG model and LSTM training layer.
The question and answers are tokenized using nltk library to vectorize words in questions and answer.
